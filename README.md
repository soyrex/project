# project
Python Script to manage projects in terminal

## What is this?
Project is my personal project manager for terminal on my OSX machine.
Basically, i work in Vim and use the terminal for most of my development
work, project allows me to maintain a list of projects and activate them
in the terminal so that i don't have to remember the path to the project
etc. It also changes my prompt to reflect the currently active project.

It's probably not useful to anyone else - but you know, maybe it will
be? If you DO like the idea or use it.. let me know @soyrex on twitter.

That's it.

## Installation
git clone
mv project /usr/local/bin (or somewhere else in your path).
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/project

run it. yeh.
